## 🎯 Problem Statement
Climate change is a global crisis, but **individual participation in sustainable practices is low** due to lack of motivation, incentives, and measurable impact.

Most existing solutions only **track carbon footprints** — they do not **encourage or reward behavioral change**.

---

## 💡 Our Solution – EcoTrack
**EcoTrack** is a **reward-based sustainability platform** that motivates users to adopt eco-friendly habits by converting their daily actions into **Climate Credits**.

Instead of penalties or restrictions, EcoTrack uses **positive reinforcement and gamification** to promote sustainable behavior.

> **“We don’t just track sustainability — we reward it.”**
