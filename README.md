## 🛠️ Hackathon Details

- **Event:** HackNITR  
- **Theme:** 🌍 *Climate & Sustainability*  
- **Project:** **EcoTrack – Personal Climate Credit System**

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Climate change is a global crisis, yet **individual participation in sustainable practices remains low**.

### Why?
- Lack of motivation  
- No direct incentives  
- Difficulty measuring personal impact  

Most existing platforms **only track carbon footprints** —  
they fail to **reward or encourage real behavioral change**.

---

## 💡 Our Solution – EcoTrack

**EcoTrack** is a **reward-based sustainability platform** that converts daily eco-friendly actions into **Climate Credits (Points)**.

Instead of penalties, EcoTrack uses **positive reinforcement, transparency, and gamification** to drive long-term sustainable habits.

> **“We don’t just track sustainability — we reward it.”**
